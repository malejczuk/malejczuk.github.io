				<b>Meditation.</b> I began my meditation practice, as do many in the West, with the intent of improving my cognitive performance. This is no longer the aim of my practice.

				<p class="about">I am now practicing to achieve enlightenment. (Although paradoxically, enlightenment is not the goal. If one has the goal of enlightenment, one will not become enlightened.)</p>
				
				<p class="about">I recommend for everyone to adopt a meditation practice. 10 minutes of daily practice is a great place for beginners to start. The <em>Waking Up</em> app by Sam Harris is a tremendous introductory tool which I strongly recommend.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Cooking.</b> I have a few friends who cannot cook. It is pathetic and sad. Learn to cook, then cook most of your meals. <p class="about"></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Don't work on weekends.</b> This applies to wage slaves. Note that I, too, am currently a wage slave. Exceptions are permitted, although rarely and almost exclusively in times of truly demanding deadlines. <p class="about"></p>

	<h2 style="margin-top:0.25em">Thought Patterns</h2>
		<ul style="padding-left:40px;margin-top:-15px;font-size:1.2em;font-family:'Open Sans';">
			<li>
				<b>Love everyone.</b> Seems obvious. Can you think of any better alternative? It's much easier to love everyone if you accept that you (and others) do not have free will. Getting upset at the person who cut you off in traffic? He couldn't help it, there was no alternative. Just remember how much you love him.

				<p class="about">When I was 22 I went to Kaua'i during American Thanksgiving. I stayed at a hostel. There was a South American man staying there at the same time as me who was deep into Eastern philosophy. I was not yet a student of Buddhism and I had hardly begun my meditation practice, so I was effectively unexposed to any of his ideas. Some of it was mumbo-jumbo (e.g. I was feeling slightly under the weather because my "chakras were not in balance"), but some of it was pretty legit. We spent some hours together over the course of my stay.</p>

				<p class="about">When I was leaving for the mainland, I was bidding farewell to a table of hostel dwellers, this man included. He said, "I love you." I knew that he meant it in an Eastern philosophical way, not in a gay way. But I still couldn't bring myself to return the sentiment. Now that I profoundly realize that I love everyone, I understand exactly what he meant. To whomever is reading this, I love you.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Everything is your fault.</b> Extremely empowering and also a great barrier against resentment. Don't take it too literally but also don't not take it literally. It's not necessarily your fault if someone cuts you off in traffic, but it is your fault if you get mad.
