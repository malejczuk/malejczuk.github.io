<p>The Studio, a podcast created and hosted by Kristoff Malejczuk, is coming soon. Kristoff will embark on soliloquies about whichever topics are of interest to him.</p>
<p>The name for the podcast comes from <a href="https://github.com/malejczuk/poetry/blob/master/theStudio/theStudio.pdf">a poem by the same name,</a> written by Kristoff in a moment of sudden and gripping inspiration on his 23rd birthday.</p>
